Path Parameters

Path parameters modify the endpoint path. The curly brackets {} in a path denote the parameters you need to specify.

For example, the path to the Download Score endpoints looks like the following: /api/v1/gti/downloadScore/{format}/{score_id}. Inside the path are two path parameters, {format} and {score_id}. To use this path in your API request, you would replace {format} with the response data format (ex. xlsx) and replace {score_id} with the value of the resultsetId.

The resultsetId is returned after sending a Calculate Score and Calculate Multipart Score request and identifies the score results.
