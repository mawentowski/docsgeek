HTTP method

An endpoint's HTTP method defines its action on a given resource. The HTTP methods the REST API uses are:

GET: Used for retrieving resources.

POST: Used for creating resources.

PATCH: Used for updating properties of resources.

DELETE: Used for deleting resources.

For example, the HTTP method for the Calculate Score endpoint is POST.
