title: About requests
---

This article covers the elements required to send requests to Steritas REST API.

Every request to the REST API includes an HTTP method and a path. Depending on the REST API endpoint, you might need to specify parameters, such as a path parameter in the URL, or include a request body.

The REST API reference documentation describes the HTTP method, path, and parameters for every endpoint. It also displays example requests and responses for each endpoint. For more information, see the OpenAPI description.
