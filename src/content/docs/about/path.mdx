Path

Each endpoint has a path. The OpenAPI description gives the path for every endpoint. For example, the path to the Calculate Score endpoint is `{algorithm}`/calculateScore.

Notice that the endpoint contains a path parameter, algorithm, used to indicate which algorithm, such as agti, bgti, mdgti, or pgti to use to calculate a score. Refer to Path parameters for more information.

When combined, the base URL and path comprise the entire resource URL. For example, the entire resource URL of the Calculate Score endpoint is https://service.steritas.com/api/v1/{algorithm}/calculateScore.
