In API documentation, "recipes sections" and "cookbook sections" typically refer to parts of the documentation that provide practical examples, tutorials, or step-by-step guides on how to use the API to achieve specific tasks or solve common problems.

Cookbook sections are similar to recipes but may encompass more comprehensive guides or tutorials. They might provide larger examples or walk developers through more complex scenarios, combining multiple API functionalities to achieve a particular outcome. Cookbook sections often provide detailed explanations alongside code snippets, helping developers grasp not only how to use the API but also why certain approaches are taken.
