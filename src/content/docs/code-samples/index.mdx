title: Code samples
---

Code samples sections in API documentation provide snippets of code demonstrating how to use specific endpoints, methods, or features of the API. These samples are typically concise and focused, aiming to illustrate the usage of the API in various programming languages or frameworks. Here's how code samples sections differ from recipes and cookbooks:

Focus and Scope:

Code Samples: These sections focus on providing direct examples of how to use specific API functionalities or endpoints. They are typically short and targeted, showcasing the syntax and parameters required for making API requests.
Recipes and Cookbooks: On the other hand, recipes and cookbooks often cover broader use cases or scenarios. They may include multiple steps, explanations, and sometimes multiple API calls to achieve a particular goal. Recipes and cookbooks are more about providing solutions to common problems or tasks using the API.
Length and Detail:

Code Samples: Code samples are usually brief and to the point. They aim to demonstrate a specific aspect of the API quickly and succinctly, without providing extensive explanations or context.
Recipes and Cookbooks: Recipes and cookbooks tend to be more detailed and comprehensive. They often include explanations of the problem being solved, background information, and additional context to help developers understand the solution and adapt it to their own needs.
Organization:

Code Samples: Code samples are typically organized based on specific API endpoints, methods, or features. Each sample may focus on a single endpoint or feature, providing examples for different programming languages or use cases.
Recipes and Cookbooks: Recipes and cookbooks are organized based on common tasks or use cases. Each recipe or tutorial may cover multiple API endpoints or features, guiding developers through a series of steps to achieve a particular outcome.
