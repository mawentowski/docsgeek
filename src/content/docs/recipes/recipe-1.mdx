In API documentation, "recipes sections" and "cookbook sections" typically refer to parts of the documentation that provide practical examples, tutorials, or step-by-step guides on how to use the API to achieve specific tasks or solve common problems.

Recipes Sections: These sections often contain small, focused examples that demonstrate how to use specific features or functionalities of the API. Each "recipe" typically addresses a common use case or problem and provides a solution or code snippet to implement it. Recipes are usually concise and easy to follow, allowing developers to quickly understand and apply the concepts in their own projects.
